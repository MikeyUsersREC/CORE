## CORE | Discord Bot

This is the open-source repository for the CORE Discord Bot. CORE is a multipurpose bot based on Discord.

## Why I Created

I created this bot so that moderation can be easier and more simutaneous than ever with built in chat commands for common moderation. Meaning if you saw someone breaking your rules, you can easily type the commands and the parameters that are required to punish the user.

## Features

CORE has many built-in commands ranging from common moderation to uses you wouldn't be able to do without. Such example of this would be finding out when a user joined your server or even muting them so that they can't talk in the server.

## How to Use

You can take the public CORE from top.gg or you can personalise it and host it your own by cloning this repository.

```git
git clone https://github.com/MikeyUsersREC/CORE.git
```

Go to discord.com/developers/applications and login if you aren't logged in.

Create a new application with the name of your choice.

Upload the application picture as what you want it to be.

Go to the Bot section and create the bot.

Copy the token by pressing the "Copy" button.

Open up bot.py in a code editor e.g Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

In the token variable, paste your token in the quotation marks.

```python
token = "TOKEN HERE"
```

Run the python file and then your bot will be online!
